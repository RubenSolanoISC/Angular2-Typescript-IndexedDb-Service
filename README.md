# Angular2 Typescript IndexedDB Service Example

This is a sample of IndexedDB Service written for Angular2 Typescript.
	
-- How it works
	I have created sample based on the quickstart app and have added a sample IndexedDBService just as example how you can create your ouwn service and start working with IndexedDB.
	
-- Installation
	- Just copy paste the Service code into your project and inject it when needed. There is also an example inclided in the repository ...
	- Clone the git repository
	- Open the command window
	- Navigate to the `example` folder
	- npm install
	- npm run typings install
	- gulp
	- npm start
	- More information at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html
	
Very basic unit tests included just to show how Observable object can be tested via jasmine.
