# Angular2 Typescript IndexedDB Service Example

This is a sample of IndexedDB Service written for Angular2 Typescript.
	
1. How it works
	- I have created Angularjs2 Typescript IndexedDB Service sample based. 
	- This is just an example how you can create your own service and start working with IndexedDB.
	
2. Installation
	- Just copy paste the Service code into your project and inject it when needed. There is also an example inclided in the repository. You can run the example by following the below steps.
	- Install the latest nodejs version.
	- Clone the git repository
	- Open the command window
	- Navigate to the `example` folder
	- npm install
	- npm run typings install
	- gulp (may throw typings errors, but will compile. Will be fixed in the next builds)
	- npm start
	- More information at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html
	
Very basic unit tests included just to show how Observable object can be tested via jasmine.
